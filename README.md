# UFC-Tableau

**Introduction**
This project aims to provide a comprehensive visual representation of the winners of UFC matches in 2023, both in terms of their physical attributes and fighting styles. By presenting this data visually, the project seeks to offer valuable insights to both betting enthusiasts and casual fans, aiding in understanding what constitutes a strong contender for victory in UFC matches.

**Problem Statement**
The primary objective of this project is to characterize the winners of UFC matches in 2023 through visual analysis. This involves examining the physical characteristics and stylistic traits of these winners to identify patterns and trends that may indicate factors contributing to their success in the octagon.

**Data Preparation**
The data preparation process involved consolidating information from multiple files and extracting relevant data points required for analysis. This included creating calculated fields to derive metrics essential for gaining insights into the UFC winners of 2023. For instance, one crucial step was generating a binary representation of match outcomes, as the winner's identity was initially represented by individual IDs, which posed challenges for visualization purposes.

**Future Work**
While the current iteration of the application remains functional, there are opportunities for future enhancements. With the availability of data for subsequent years, such as 2024, there is potential to revisit the analysis and visualization to assess if similar insights persist or if there have been significant shifts in the UFC "meta." Continual refinement and adaptation of the project will ensure its relevance and utility in providing valuable insights to UFC enthusiasts.
